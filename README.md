# Auto Driving Car Simulation

Welcome to the Auto Driving Car Simulation program! This Python simulation allows you to create a rectangular field, add cars to it, and run a simulation of their movements based on user-defined commands.

## Features

- Create a rectangular field by specifying its width and height.
- Add multiple cars to the field, each with a unique name, starting position, and direction they are facing.
- Run a simulation to execute movement commands for each car and detect collisions.
- Interactive command-line interface for user interaction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Usage

- Navigate to the project directory: cd car-simulation
- Run the program: python car_simulation.py
- Follow the on-screen instructions to create a field, add cars, and run simulations.
